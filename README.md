# My First Portfolio

This is my first website for a class project. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a simple page about me.

***

### What it has:
* A part about me, my projects, and how to contact me.
* A button to change the theme from light to dark.
* A welcome message when you open the page.
* It also says "Good Morning" or "Good Afternoon" depending on the time.

***

### How I used AI:

I used ChatGPT and Gemini to help me with this project. I used them when I got stuck to:

* Help fix bugs in my code.
* Show me the right way to write some code.
* Give me some picture ideas for my projects.


# Assignment 2: Interactive Portfolio

This project is phase two of my personal portfolio website. I built on the foundation from Assignment 1 by adding **advanced interactivity**, **data handling**, and crucial **user feedback** to create a more professional and dynamic web application.

***

##  New Features in this Version

This updated version now includes dynamic elements driven by JavaScript, making it much more interactive:

### 1. Dynamic Projects and Filtering
* **Data Handling:** Project information is now stored in a **JavaScript data array**.
* **Interactive Filtering:** Added buttons that let you instantly **filter** the project list to see only "Web Projects" or "Design Projects" (Dynamic Content requirement).

### 2. User Preferences and Persistence
* **Theme Storage:** The Dark/Light mode button now saves your choice using the browser's **Local Storage**. If you switch the theme, the website remembers your preference when you visit again (Data Handling requirement).

### 3. Error Handling and User Feedback
* **Form Validation:** The Contact Form now checks if all required fields are filled and if the email format is correct.
* **Inline Feedback:** If a field is missed, a **red error message appears right next to the input** (Error Handling requirement).
* **Animated Success:** On successful submission, a smooth, fading success message appears (Animation and User Feedback requirements).

### 4. Code Refinement
* The CSS was cleaned up using **CSS Variables** (Custom Properties) to make the light and dark themes much easier to manage.

## How I Used AI (Assignment 2 Focus)

I used AI tools like **[Insert Your AI Tool Name, e.g., Gemini or ChatGPT]** to assist with complex logic and code quality for this assignment:

* **Logic Generation:** Getting the structure right for the **Local Storage theme persistence** and the complex **Form Validation** logic.
* **Code Refactoring:** Used AI to review my original CSS and suggest the move to **CSS Variables** (`:root` and `var()`) for cleaner code organization and better performance.
* **Accessibility Check:** Asked AI to verify the color contrast of my themes to ensure the portfolio is accessible and easy to read.

# 🤖 AI Usage Report

This document explains **how AI was used** during the development of this portfolio project.

---

##  Purpose of AI Usage
AI (ChatGPT) was used as:
- A tutor to help understand JavaScript concepts  
- A debugging assistant  
- A code explanation tool  
- A helper to improve readability and documentation  

AI **did NOT** write the full project automatically.  
All code was:  
✔️ written manually  
✔️ modified by the student  
✔️ understood and tested by the student

##  What AI Helped With

### 1️ Debugging JavaScript
AI helped identify mistakes such as:
- Missing event listeners  
- Wrong DOM selectors  
- LocalStorage behavior  
- Logic errors in sorting/filtering  

### 2 Improving Code Structure
AI suggested:
- Cleaner functions  
- Better variable names  
- Separation of logic and UI  

### 3 Documentation
AI helped generate:
- README.md  
- Technical documentation  
- AI usage file  
- Descriptions for each feature  

### 4️ Learning Assistance
AI explained concepts such as:
- `fetch()` API and JSON parsing  
- `localStorage` lifecycle  
- Promises & async code  
- Form validation logic

##  What AI Did NOT Do
AI **did NOT**:
- Replace my own coding  
- Build the whole project alone  
- Generate HTML/CSS templates  
- Make design decisions  
- Implement features without my understanding  

All code was reviewed, edited, and validated by me.

## ✔️ Academic Honesty Statement
I confirm that:
- I used AI responsibly  
- I understood every part of the code  
- AI was used only to **assist learning**, not to complete the assignment automatically
